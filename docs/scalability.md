# Scalability Guide for MLOps Platform

This document outlines the scalability considerations and configurations for the MLOps Platform.

## Architecture for Scalability

The MLOps Platform is designed with scalability in mind at multiple levels:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: API services scale horizontally based on load
2. **Vertical Partitioning**: Services are split by functionality
3. **Caching**: Multi-level caching to reduce computational load
4. **Statelessness**: API services are stateless, enabling easy scaling
5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Background jobs for long-running tasks

## Kubernetes Scaling Configuration

The platform uses Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale based on metrics:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: mlops-api-hpa
spec:
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
```
